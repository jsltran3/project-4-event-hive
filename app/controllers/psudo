# Write a custom route that takes in a parameter n and looks at all the bands and finds any bands that have more concert tickets than n.
    # Return all the bands who meet this condition.
    #  If no bands met the condition then you should render json that says so

n 
if cold play
http://localhost:3000/bands/:n

create route for n in routes.rubyonrails
create method in bands that finds n 
in method find bands find_by 
map through all bands based on n/count 
return all bands if match n/count
return the tickets from n


find what bands have the most concert tickets 

n is a concert ticket 
create route in routes
in method loop through  concert tickets
find the way to quantify the concert tickets using .count 
while looping through, add code block if band.concerttickets.count > params n 
then return that band  or mult band save to variable and take that and return array of bands or singular band 

make sure you're iterate over association without goign to that controller
